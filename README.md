First Commit: Created Content in Strapi. Used Hardcoded Data to display content in the front end using React. Shared Data between components using properties. Rendered multiple components using the map function.

Connect React with Strapi: Worked with useState and useEffect hooks to mount the data from strapi in the frontend page. Use an Async function in useEffect to load data.
